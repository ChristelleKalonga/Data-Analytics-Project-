# Data-Analytics-Project-
This project showcase my SQL, Power BI and EXCEL skills by doing a sale performance analysis of a retail dataset to draw draw meaningful conclusions.
I used Excel formulas to firstly analyse the data, then used SQL for further analysis the dataset by using queries and sub queries. 
Lastly, I used Power BI to create a graphical represenation of my dataset. 

The dataset has two tables including retail_transactions and retail_customers.
I used the SUMIF formula to calculate the total amount of sales by product category. I then used MAX function to find the top selling product and MIN function to find the product category with the minimun amount of sales. Books and clothing were the products with the highest and lowest amount of sales. 

I used SQL to be able to find:
- Book is the product category in high demand between Male and Female with the amount of sales generated.  
- Clothing is the most returned product category with the least amount of sales which generated a profit loss. 

I Used Power BI to visualise my data and get some meaning from the dataset such as:
- The business has 51% of men customers and 49% of women customers with the average age of 41. 
- Revenues clearly started to grow from 2011 to 2013 but then started to decline from 2013, dropping 84.82% in 2014 resulting in a loss of profit of 12,495,973.17. Customer orders fell significantly in 2014, from 7,456 in 2013 to 1,065. 
- This massive drop in 2014 can be explained by two major factors, including the drop in customer orders and the increase in product returns.
